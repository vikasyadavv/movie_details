I’ll be introducing an Apple Shortcut that I created, called “Movie Information Fetcher.”
With just one click, this shortcut lets you instantly fetch detailed information about any movie. You’ll get the IMDb rating, votes, genres, release date, awards, directors, actors, and even a short description—all in seconds.
So, if you’re someone who loves movies and enjoys digging into all the details, then this shortcut is definitely for you. It’s simple, quick, and extremely useful.

✅ How it works
Running the shortcut is super easy. Just click on it, and it will ask you for the movie name.
Type the name, hit “Done,” and within a fraction of a second, all the details appear right on your screen.
For example, let’s try “The Terminal.” As soon as I enter the name, you can see it instantly pulls out all the information—ratings, cast, and more.
Now let’s try another one: “Wanted.” Again, within seconds, everything you need to know is fetched automatically.
And just like that, you can try it for any movie you like.

💡 Is it free?
Yes! The shortcut is completely free to use and the setup is very simple.

📥 How to get it
I’ve shared the download link in the description below.
To install, simply open the link in any browser and click the “Get Shortcut” button.
It will open directly in the Shortcuts app on your iPhone or Mac.
Then, just tap “Add Shortcut” and it will be ready to use.

🔑 Getting your API Key
Now, to make this shortcut work, you’ll need a free API key from OMDb. Don’t worry—it only takes a minute!
Visit the website omdbapi.com (link in the description).
Click on the “API Key” button in the top menu.
Under account type, select FREE.
Enter your email address, first name, and last name.
For “Usage,” simply type testing and then submit the form.
Within a minute, you’ll receive a confirmation email with your API key.
Copy that key, open the downloaded shortcut, and paste it into the TEXT section. That’s it!

You now have a powerful free shortcut that can fetch detailed movie information anytime you want.
So go ahead, try it out, and let me know what movies you checked first.
